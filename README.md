# ml_fitness_classification
This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow to predict whether an individual is "Fit" or "Not Fit" based on health and lifestyle metrics. The implementation includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and a comparative analysis of multiple classification models through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
